# Predicting-Hazardous-Seismic-Bumps
Mining activity was and is always connected with the occurrence of dangers which are commonly called
mining hazards. A special case of such threat is a seismic hazard which frequently occurs in many
underground mines. Seismic hazard is the hardest detectable and predictable of natural hazards and in
this respect it is comparable to an earthquake. More and more advanced seismic and seismoacoustic
monitoring systems allow a better understanding rock mass processes and definition of seismic hazard
prediction methods. Accuracy of so far created methods is however far from perfect. Complexity of
seismic processes and big disproportion between the number of low-energy seismic events and the number
of high-energy phenomena (e.g. > 10^4J) causes the statistical techniques to be insufficient to predict
seismic hazard. Therefore, it is essential to search for new opportunities of better hazard prediction,
also using Machine Learning methods.
